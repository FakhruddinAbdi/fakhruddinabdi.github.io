 Hello :)
 My name is Fakhruddin Abdi.
 <br/>`I am a developer based in Sanandaj, Iran`.
 
<br/>`I have been using Ubuntu` for a quite some time. Because i believe terminal can save a lot of time :).
Now Im coding and working on macOS.
<br/>`Started programming with C language`. The root of most modern languages.
<br/>`Then started` learning object-oriented version of C, which is `C++`.

`I was really impressed with concept of OOP` and how it can turn your code into a living character. 
In the last two years of my university season, `i started website developing`.
My first website was made with html and jquery and bootstrap. Learning from W3Schools :).
`I slowly started to like functional programming`. No need to spent much time to shape your object. Just define your pure function and go ahead :D.
I browsed simple themes on internet and started recreating them. If I ever got stuck at something I would simply state my problem on forums to understand what I am doing wrong.
I started getting doing websites for my friends for really cheap or for local charities and NGOs for either cheap or free.

`Then spent a short time on .NET` options like C# and WPF using MVVM architecture ( less than a year).
In the mean time `i was developing with PHP and Laravel and Drupal CMS using MVC architecture` ( more than a year).


<p>Like many others, i quickly started to hate microsof technologies.</p>

And finally `i have started conding in new Javascript frameworks like Angualr and now ReactJS` . Learning from FreeCodeCamp, Udacity and Mozila.

<p style="font-weight: 400"> Now i believe javascript is the most successful language and ReactJS framework with its Redux/Flux architecture is a revolution in the programming world.
So i will continue coding with javascript :). </p>
